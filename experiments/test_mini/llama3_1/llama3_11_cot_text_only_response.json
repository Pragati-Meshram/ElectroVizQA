The NAND gate is a universal gate, meaning that any digital circuit can be constructed using only NAND gates. The NOR gate is also a universal gate. The NAND gate is the inverse of the NOR gate.

The NOR gate is the inverse of the OR gate, so the NOR gate is equivalent to an inverter of an OR gate. The inverter of an OR gate is an XOR gate. (B)  The inputs of the NAND gate are inverted, so the gate is equivalent to a NOR gate. The NOR gate is"

The clock signal (CLK) in a J-K flip-flop circuit is used to synchronize the state changes. It ensures that the flip-flop changes its state only at specific times, which are determined by the clock signal's rising or falling edge. This synchronization is crucial for maintaining the flip-flop's stability and preventing unwanted state changes.

Assume area is total number of gates used added with total number of inputs. Assume complemented inputs are available.  Choices: (A) 0 (B) 2 (C) 4 (D) 6 \nAnswer: Let's think step by step. The K-Map is given as: B' + AC'. The expression B' + AC' can be simplified as follows: B' + AC' = B' + A(C' + C) = B' + A(1) = B' + A. The expression B' + A can be implemented using 2 gates: 1 OR gate and 1 NOT gate. Therefore, the total number of gates used is 2. The total number of inputs is 2"
