One version states:  (A + B)' = A'B'\n\n* **Applying De Morgan's Law:**\n   1. Start with the desired output: A'B + AB'\n   2. Invert both sides:  (A'B + AB')' \n   3. Apply De Morgan's Law: (A'B)'(AB')'\n   4. Simplify using double negation: (A + B')(A' + B)\n\n* **Building the Circuit:** This final simplified form translates to the following:\n    1.  One AND gate to compute (A + B')\n    2.  One AND gate to compute (A' + B)\n    3.

A NOR gate outputs 0 if *any* input is 1. Therefore, the output of the top NOR gate (Q) becomes 0.\n    * **Bottom NOR gate:** Input S=1 and Q=0. Again, due to the NOR gate logic, the output of the bottom gate (Q') becomes 0. \n4. **New State:** We now have Q=0 and Q'=0. However, this is a temporary and invalid state for an RS latch. Q and Q' are supposed to be complements of each other.\n5. **Latch Behavior:** The RS latch, due to its feedback mechanism, will quickly stabilize. Since S=1 is the dominant input in this scenario (R being 0 doesn't actively influence the output), the latch will settle into the Set state.\n\n**Therefore, the new output state will be Set (Q=1, Q'=0).**\n\n**Answer: (A)** \n"

This instability makes the latch unreliable in certain situations.\n\n2. **Noise and the \"forbidden\" state:**  Noise in a circuit can inadvertently set both inputs to a high state. In a NAND-based RS latch, this triggers the unstable \"forbidden\" state, potentially causing the stored data to be lost or corrupted.\n\n3. **Comparing to other latches:**  Other types of latches and flip-flops, like D latches or JK flip-flops, are designed with mechanisms to avoid this \"forbidden\" state and are generally more robust against noise.\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the primary disadvantage of using a NAND-based RS latch compared to other latches or flip-flops is its **(D) Susceptibility to noise**. \n"

Question: A vending machine dispenses a product given certain sets of inputs, and this output behavior is given by the K-Map. Each of the \"inputs\", A, B, and C, represent different buttons on the vending machine. Let's assume we use only one OR gate to build the vending machine circuit minimally. How many AND gates would we need? Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 ",
        "response": "Let's think step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the K-Map:** The K-Map represents the Boolean expression B' + AC'. This means the vending machine dispenses a product if either B is NOT pressed (B') OR both A and C' are pressed.\n\n2. **OR Gate Requirement:** The problem specifies using only ONE OR gate.  This confirms our K-map interpretation \u2013 one OR gate combines the two conditions (B' and AC').\n\n3. **AND Gate Requirement:**  We need to generate the term AC'. This requires one AND gate. \n\n**Answer: (B) 1** \n"

        "response": "Let's break down how a 2:4 decoder works and its gate requirements.\n\n**Understanding a 2:4 Decoder**\n\n* **Input:** A 2:4 decoder takes in 2 input lines (let's call them A and B).\n* **Output:** It produces 4 output lines. Each output line corresponds to a unique combination of the inputs.\n* **Functionality:**  Essentially, it \"decodes\" the binary input into a specific output line being activated (set to HIGH).\n\n**Logic Implementation**\n\nTo achieve this, a 2:4 decoder typically uses the following:\n\n* **NOT Gates:**  You need two NOT gates to invert the input signals (A and B), providing both the original and inverted versions.\n* **AND Gates:** You need four AND gates. Each AND gate corresponds to one output line and receives signals from the input lines (or their inversions) in a way that activates only for the specific input combination.\n\n**Example**\n\nLet's say output line 0 should be HIGH when A=0 and B=0. The AND gate for output 0 would receive inputs NOT A and NOT B.\n\n**Answer**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(C) All of the above**. A 2:4 decoder uses 4 AND gates and 2 NOT gates. \n"

(A nand B) and (C nand D) each produce the opposite of an AND gate's output.\n\n2. **Combining results:** The outer NAND gate takes the results of those inner NAND operations and performs another NAND.  Essentially, it's inverting the output of what would have been an AND operation on the results of the inner NANDs.\n\n3. **Double Negation:** Remember that two consecutive inversions (NOT operations) cancel each other out. Since NAND is AND followed by NOT, the two layers of NAND gates essentially boil down to just the AND operation.\n\n4. **Final representation:**  We're left with an AND gate followed by a NOT gate to account for the final inversion.\n\n**Answer: D** \n"
