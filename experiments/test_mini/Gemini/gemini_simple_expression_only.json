Otherwise, it outputs '0'.\n* **NAND Gate:** Outputs '0' only when both inputs are '1'. Otherwise, it outputs '1'.\n* **The Expression:**  `J = (A nor B) nand (C nor D) nand (E nor F) nand (G nor H)` \n    * This expression will be '1' in many cases. It only evaluates to '0' when *all* the individual NOR terms are '1' (because only then will the NANDing of all those '1's result in a '0').\n\n**Replacing NAND with NOR**\n\nIf we replace the final NAND gate with a NOR gate, the output will now be '1' *only* when all the individual NOR terms are '0'. Let's illustrate why this leads to more '0's:\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine A=0, B=1, C=0, D=1, E=0, F=1, G=0, H=1.\n\n* **Original Expression (with NAND):**\n    * (A nor B) = 0, (C nor D) = 0, (E nor F) = 0, (G nor H) = 0\n    * 0 nand 0 nand 0 nand 0 = 1 \n* **Modified Expression (with NOR):**\n    * (A nor B) = 0, (C nor D) = 0, (E nor F) = 0, (G nor H) = 0\n    * 0 nor 0 nor 0 nor 0 = 1 nor 0 = 0 \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy changing the final NAND gate to a NOR gate, we've made the output more restrictive.

However, any slight noise or fluctuation in the input signals, even for a very short duration, can cause the latch to switch states unpredictably. This instability in the face of noise makes the basic RS latch less reliable than other latch designs, especially in noisy environments.\n\nLet's look at the other options:\n\n* **(A) Limited number of stable states:** RS latches have two stable states, which is the fundamental characteristic of a latch or flip-flop. This is not a disadvantage.\n* **(B) Increased power consumption:** While NAND gates themselves might have slightly higher power consumption than some other logic gates,  the difference is not usually a primary concern when choosing between latch types.\n* **(C) Complexity in design:** RS latches, especially those built with NAND gates, are among the simplest latch designs.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (D).** \n"

Here's a breakdown:\n\n    * **Set (S' = 0, R' = 1):**  Forces output Q to 1.\n    * **Reset (S' = 1, R' = 0):** Forces output Q to 0.\n    * **Hold (S' = 1, R' = 1):** Maintains the previous output (Q remains as it was).\n    * **Forbidden (S' = 0, R' = 0):**  Both outputs (Q and Q') tend towards 1. This is unstable because the outputs should ideally be opposites. \n\n* **Why R' = S' = 1 Leads to Metastability**\n\n    When both inputs are high (R' = S' = 1), you're essentially driving both NAND gates towards the \"Forbidden\" state. The outputs try to settle into a stable state but can't due to the inherent nature of the feedback loop. This results in rapid oscillation or a metastable state where the output rapidly switches between 0 and 1.\n\n**Important Note:**  Metastable states are undesirable in digital circuits because they are unpredictable and can cause errors in downstream logic. \n"

This transition is the \"rising edge\" or \"positive edge\".\n\n* **Data Storage/Change:** At the rising edge of the clock, whatever value is present on the 'D' input gets \"latched\" or \"stored\" inside the flip-flop. The output (Q) then reflects this stored value until the next rising edge.\n\n**Let's break down the other options:**\n\n* **(A) Values freeze every second:** This would imply a fixed clock frequency of 1 Hz.

Therefore, output D1 will be '1', and all other outputs (D0, D2, D3) will be '0'.\n\n4. **Decimal Value:** Since only D1 is '1', the output bits represent the decimal value 1.\n\n**Answer: B** \n"

Choices: (A) OR gate followed by NOT gate (B) NOR gate followed by NOT gate (C) XOR followed by NOT gate (D) AND followed by NOT gate ",
        "response": "Let's break down the logic to determine the equivalent gate representation:\n\n1. **Understanding NAND:** A NAND gate outputs FALSE (0) only when both inputs are TRUE (1). Otherwise, it outputs TRUE (1).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Figure:**  You describe a circuit with two levels of NAND gates:\n   * Level 1: (A NAND B) and (C NAND D) \n   * Level 2: The results of the Level 1 NAND gates are fed into a final NAND gate.\n\n3. **Simplifying with Boolean Logic:**\n   * Let X = (A NAND B)\n   * Let Y = (C NAND D)\n   * The final output is (X NAND Y)\n\n   Now, recall that a NAND gate is equivalent to an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.  Let's apply this:\n   * X = NOT(A OR B)\n   * Y = NOT(C OR D)\n   * (X NAND Y) = NOT (X OR Y) = NOT (NOT(A OR B) OR NOT(C OR D))\n\n4. **Applying De Morgan's Theorem:** De Morgan's theorem helps simplify the expression further. It states:\n   * NOT (A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B) \n\n   Using this, our final expression becomes:\n   * NOT (NOT(A OR B) OR NOT(C OR D))  =  (A OR B) AND (C OR D)\n\n5. **Final Representation:**  We've arrived at the equivalent representation: an AND gate where each input is the result of an OR gate. However, this doesn't match any of the provided options directly. \n\n   Let's consider the relationship between AND and NOR gates:\n    *  (A AND B) = NOT(NOT(A AND B)) = NOT (A NOR B)\n\n   Therefore, our final expression can be written as:\n   * (A OR B) AND (C OR D) = NOT((A OR B) NOR (C OR D))\n\n**Answer:** This matches option **(B) NOR gate followed by NOT gate** \n"
