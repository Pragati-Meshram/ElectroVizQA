This sets output Q to 1 and P to 0.\n   * **Set = 0, Reset = 1:** The bottom NAND gate will output 0, forcing the top NAND gate to output 1.

The circuit shown is a **Gated D Latch**. This latch uses NAND gates to control data storage based on the inputs D (Data), WE (Write Enable), and its inverse.\n3.  When WE = 1, its inverse (the line connected to the bottom NAND gates) becomes 0. \n4.  This 0 forces the output of the bottom left NAND gate to 1, regardless of the value of D.\n5.  Now, the top right NAND gate receives a 1 from the previous gate and likely a 0 from the inverted Q output (assuming the latch isn't already in an unstable state). This combination produces a 1 at the output Q.\n6. With Q = 1, its inverse becomes 0, feeding back into the top left NAND gate. This ensures that even if D changes, the output Q remains latched to the value it had when WE transitioned to 1.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The value of D is copied to Q.** \n\n**C** \n",

Even a small glitch or spurious signal on either input can cause the latch to flip its state unpredictably. This makes the SR latch unreliable in environments with electrical noise.\n\nLet's examine why the other options are less significant:\n\n* **(A) Limited number of stable states:** The SR latch has two stable states (Q=0 or Q=1), which is the fundamental requirement of a latch or flip-flop.\n* **(B) Increased power consumption:** While the cross-coupled structure does lead to some static power consumption, it's not the primary concern compared to noise sensitivity.\n* **(C) Complexity in design:** The SR latch is actually one of the simplest latches to design, making this option incorrect. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (D).** \n",

        "response": "The combination of two NOT gates and a NOR gate effectively acts as an OR gate. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **NOT gate:** Inverts the input signal (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0).\n* **NOR gate:** Outputs 1 only if both inputs are 0.\n\nLet's analyze the circuit's behavior:\n\n1. Each input (A, B, C, D) is first inverted by a NOT gate.\n2. The NOR gate receives two inverted inputs at a time. \n3. The NOR gate will output 1 only if both inverted inputs are 0, meaning both original inputs were 1.\n\nThis logic is the same as an OR gate: it outputs 1 if at least one of its inputs is 1.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is (D) NOR gate.** \n",
