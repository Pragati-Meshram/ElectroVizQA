        "response": "The correct answer is **(D) There would be more instances of the output being 0**. Here's why:\n\n* **Original Circuit:** The circuit implements a 4-input NAND gate followed by an inverter.  A NAND gate outputs 0 only when all inputs are 1. The inverter then flips this to a 1. This means the output (J) is 1 most of the time, except for the single case where all inputs (A, C, E, G) are 1.\n\n* **Replacing with NOR:** A NOR gate outputs 1 only when all inputs are 0.  Replacing the NAND with a NOR means the output of that first stage will be 1 much less frequently (only when A, C, E, and G are all 0). The inverter will then flip this to a 0.\n\n**In summary:** Changing the NAND to a NOR makes the output 0 in many more input combinations than the original circuit. \n",

Let's break down how it works:\n\n**Understanding the Circuit**\n\n* **D Latch:**  At its core, this is a D latch, which stores a single bit of data ('D'). The output (Q) reflects the stored data when the latch is \"enabled.\"\n* **Gating:** The circuit uses logic gates to control when the D input is allowed to affect the output Q. \n\n**Analyzing with D = 1**\n\n1. **Initial State (before clock edge):** We don't know the initial state of Q and Q-bar.  This is okay; we only care about the state *after* the clock edge.\n\n2. **Clock Edge Arrives:** This is where things happen. Let's trace the logic:\n   * Assuming a positive edge-triggered clock, the NOT gates connected to the clock will briefly output '0'.\n   * This '0' propagates through the AND gates, effectively disabling the D input path to the latch. \n   * **Crucially:** Since the input is disabled during the clock edge, the previous state of Q and Q-bar will be maintained.\n\n3. **After the Clock Edge:**  The NOT gates return to '1', but the D input had no effect during the brief clock transition. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBecause the circuit is a gated D latch and the input is disabled during the clock edge, the value of Q will remain unchanged regardless of the value of D.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot determine the value of Q after the clock edge with the given information.**\n\n**No correct option is provided.** \n",

The other Q outputs remain at their initial state (likely 0).\n    2. **Clock Cycle 2:** The second clock cycle shifts the '1' from Q3 to Q2, and a new '1' from SI is loaded into Q3.

        "response": "The correct answer is **(C) Adding logic to the clock path causes clock skew and timing issues**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Clock Skew:** In digital circuits, the clock signal needs to arrive at all components as close to simultaneously as possible. When you add logic gates to the clock path, it introduces delays. This means the clock edge will reach the D flip-flop at a slightly different time than it reaches other parts of your circuit. This difference in arrival time is called clock skew.\n\n* **Timing Issues:**  Clock skew can lead to setup and hold time violations in sequential circuits. \n    * **Setup time:** The time the input data must be stable *before* the clock edge. \n    * **Hold time:** The time the input data must be stable *after* the clock edge. \n   If the clock arrives at different times due to skew, the data might not be stable for the required periods, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n\n**Other options:**\n\n* **(A) Circuit is too slow:** While adding logic does introduce some delay, it's not the primary issue in this context.\n* **(B) Circuit is too fast:** This isn't a relevant concern in this case.\n* **(D) There is not enough logic to control the clock:** The issue isn't about the amount of logic but its placement on the sensitive clock path.\n\n**In Summary:**  It's crucial to maintain a clean clock path in digital design to avoid timing issues caused by clock skew. \n",

This means S1+ (the next state of S1) will be the same as the current S1.\n* **If HOLD = 0:** The counter should advance. Examining the state transitions in the counting sequence (00, 01, 11, 10), we see S1 toggles (changes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) with each count.\n\nNow let's look at the answer choices:\n\n* **(A) HOLD:** This only covers the case where HOLD = 1, not when the counter advances.\n* **(B) (HOLD)'S0 + (HOLD)S1:** This is closer. It handles HOLD = 1 correctly (outputting S1). When HOLD = 0, it outputs S0, which doesn't reflect the toggling behavior.\n* **(C) (HOLD)S0 + (HOLD)'S1':** This is incorrect. It outputs S0 when HOLD = 1 and the inverse of S1 when HOLD = 0. \n* **(D) (HOLD)(S1' + S0')':** This is also incorrect. While it might seem to handle some cases, it doesn't accurately represent the desired behavior for all combinations of HOLD, S1, and S0.\n\n**None of the given options are correct.**\n\nHere's how we can derive the correct expression:\n\nWhen HOLD = 0, S1 should toggle.
