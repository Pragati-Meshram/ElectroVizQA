If we build this circuit using only OR and AND gates, we need to replicate the functionality of the NOR gates.\n\nA NOR gate can be constructed using OR and AND gates by using De Morgan's laws. Specifically, a NOR gate is the negation of the OR of its inputs (\\( A \\nor B = \\neg (A \\lor B) \\)). This can be built with an OR gate followed by an AND gate for the negation (assuming negations are available).\n\nTo replace each NOR gate with OR and AND gates:\n1. OR gate to combine the inputs.\n2. AND gate with negation for the NOR functionality.\n\nThis essentially replaces 1 NOR gate with 1 OR gate and 1 AND gate.\n\nSince we have two NOR gates:\n1. Two NOR gates would be replaced by two OR gates and two AND gates.\n\nAfter the replacement:\n- The combined delay of each OR gate and AND gate would be greater than the original NOR gate. However, comparing the two configurations:\n  - Original NOR gate configurations require 1 gate delay each, resulting in a total of 2 gate delays before going to the final OR gate.\n  - Reconstructed NOR requires 1 OR + 1 AND gate for each NOR gate replaced, keeping the configuration delay equivalent to 2 gate delays (1 OR + 1 AND treated as a single equivalent unit).\n\nTherefore, the delay to achieve the same output logic functionality from OR-AND minimally would mirror the original NOR circuit structure. The overall delay of the circuit remains effectively unchanged with the new gate configuration.\n\nThe correct option is:\n(D) Would not change",

        "response": "To solve this problem, let's first clarify which input conditions correspond to which cells in the Karnaugh map (K-Map):\n\n- The K-Map is for a function of three variables A, B, and C.\n- A'B'C' (000) is the scenario \"Pressing none\" (not present here).\n- A'B'C (001) is the scenario \"Pressing only C\".\n- A'BC' (010) is the scenario \"Pressing only B\".\n- A'BC (011) is the scenario \"Pressing B and C\".\n- AB'C' (100) is the scenario \"Pressing only A\".\n- AB'C (101) is the scenario \"Pressing A and C\".\n- ABC' (110) is the scenario \"Pressing A and B\".\n- ABC (111) is the scenario \"Pressing A, B, and C\".\n\nThe question asks which of the scenarios, when the vending machine dispenses a product instead of not dispensing it, will cause the vending machine circuit to become larger.\n\nLet's analyze where the zeros are:\n\n- \"Pressing only A\" is (100), which is captured in cell (A'B', C') - this is currently `1`.\n- \"Pressing only A and C\" is (101), which is captured in cell (A'B', C) - this is currently `1`.\n- \"Pressing A, B, and C\" is (111), which is captured in cell (AB, C) - this is currently `0`.\n- \"Pressing only B and C\" is (010), which is captured in cell (A'B, C) - this is currently `0`.\n\nChanging the scenario from 0 to 1 will add a product term to the logic, making the circuit larger. Adding only A and C (101) will not change the circuit, as it is already `1`.\n\nThus, changing either \"Pressing A, B, and C (111)\" or \"Pressing only B and C (010)\" will add a term.\n\nIn this context, the best option would be to select the new scenario that will indeed increase the complexity of the circuit the most.\nGiven the layout, changing \"Pressing A, B, and C (111)\" leads to a less simplified form of the logic, making the circuit larger.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(C) Pressing A, B, and C",

Question: Suppose we want to figure out whether a given 7-bit ASCII code, C, represents a uppercase letter. The following diagram functions to do so. What values of Z1 and Z0 are not used for a meaningful output? Choices: (A) Z1 = Z0 = 0 (B) Z1 = 0, Z0 = 1 (C) Z1 = Z0 = 1 (D) Z1 = 1, Z0 = 0 ",
        "response": "To determine whether the 7-bit ASCII code C represents an uppercase letter, let's analyze the given diagram and the logic it employs.\n\n1. **Understanding ASCII Range for Uppercase Letters**:\n   - Uppercase letters (A-Z) in ASCII range from 65 to 90, in binary: `0x41` (01000001) to `0x5A` (01011010).\n\n2. **Diagram Analysis**:\n   - The diagram shows two 7-bit comparators.\n   - The first comparator compares C with `0x41` (decimal 65), and its outputs are Z1 (set if C >= 65) and Z0 (set if C = 65).\n   - The second comparator compares C with `0x5A` (decimal 90), and its outputs are Z1 (set if C <= 90) and Z0 (set if C = 90).\n   - The outputs from both comparators are combined in a logical OR gate which outputs U.\n\n   For the given 7-bit ASCII to be an uppercase letter, the following conditions must be met:\n   - \\( Z1 \\) of the first comparator (C >= 65) must be true.\n   - \\( Z1 \\) of the second comparator (C <= 90) must also be true.\n\n3. **Unused Values for a Meaningful Output**:\n   - Z0 in both comparators indicates equality, which isn't relevant for verifying range checks.\n   - The only condition directly used to verify uppercase range is the combination of \\(Z1 \\) from both comparators.\n\n   Unused values would therefore be the equality checks which are \\( Z0 \\).\n\n\\( \\therefore \\) The combination of \\( Z1 = Z0 = 0 \\) is not used for meaningful output.\n\nSo, the correct option is \\( (A) Z1 = Z0 = 0 \\).\n\nCorrect option: \\( (A) \\)",

A D flip-flop captures the value of the D input at the moment of a rising edge of the CLOCK signal.\n2. The output Q will change to the D value only at that rising edge.\n3.

Since the rising edge of the clock has not yet occurred, the first flip-flop whose D is connected receives a constant value but does not update its Q output.\n2. Therefore, the intermediate output X (the Q of the first flip-flop) remains unchanged.\n3.
