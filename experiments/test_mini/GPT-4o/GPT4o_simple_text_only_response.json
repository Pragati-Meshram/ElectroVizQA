        "response": "To determine how the delay of the circuit would change if we built it minimally from only OR and AND gates, we need to analyze the circuit's logic and then consider its implementation with NAND gates versus OR and AND gates.\n\nFirstly, let's transform the NOR gates to OR and AND gates. The expression given is:\n\nE = (A NOR B) NOR (C NOR D)\n\nUsing De Morgan's laws, a NOR gate can be expressed in terms of OR and NOT gates:\n\nA NOR B = NOT (A OR B)\n\nTherefore,\n\nE = NOT (NOT (A OR B) OR NOT (C OR D))\n\nFurther simplifying:\n\n= NOT ((A OR B) AND (C OR D))\n\nThus, E can be represented minimally using OR and AND gates as:\n\n1. Compute A OR B\n2. Compute C OR D\n3. Compute (A OR B) AND (C OR D)\n4. Invert the result of step 3\n\nLet's compare the gate delays for the original and the OR-AND implementation.\n\n### Original NOR-Gate Implementation:\n- Step 1: A NOR B -> 1 NOR gate\n- Step 2: C NOR D -> 1 NOR gate\n- Step 3: (Result of Step 1) NOR (Result of Step 2) -> 1 NOR gate\n\nTotal delay: 3 NOR gate delays\n\n### OR-AND Implementation:\n- Step 1: Compute A OR B -> 1 OR gate\n- Step 2: Compute C OR D -> 1 OR gate\n- Step 3: Compute (A OR B) AND (C OR D) -> 1 AND gate\n- Step 4: Invert the result (equivalent to a NOR) from step 3 -> 1 NOR gate\n\nTotal delay: 3 gate delays (1 OR + 1 OR + 1 AND + 1 NOR)\n\nTherefore, on comparing the delays:\n- The original NOR implementation has a total of 3 NOR gate delays.\n- The OR-AND implementation also has a total of 3 gate delays (although of different types).\n\nThus, converting the circuit from NOR gates to a minimal implementation using only OR and AND gates would **not change** the total delay.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\nAnswer: D"

Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Terms**:\n   The given expression has three terms:\n      - \\( BD \\)\n      - \\( AD \\)\n      - \\( A'B'C \\)\n\n2. **Convert each term to POS form**:\n   We want to identify how each of these terms will influence the minimal POS form. In the Sum of Products (SOP) form like \\( BD + AD + A'B'C \\), each individual product term translates to a bracketed sum in POS form.\n   \n   Let's express each term separately into its POS form (using De Morgan's laws):\n   - \\( BD \\) becomes \\( (B + D') \\)\n   - \\( AD \\) becomes \\( (A + D') \\)\n   - \\( A'B'C \\) typically inverts directly but may need manipulation for intersection\n   \n3. **Combine terms**:\n   The critical part is to merge these expressions considering their minimal intersections in POS form. Instead of converting them and then re-merging (which could be complex without Boolean simplification algorithms), we ask how many individual minimal groupings will appear:\n\n   When terms are in SOP (Sum of Products) form and we translate them into the minimal POS form, typically, each independent product term transforms as shown:\n   - Direct minimal conversion isn't always 1-to-1 for simplification but as expressions were given (minding the typical boolean steps we follow), they indicate three distinct product terms:\n   \n4. **Determine Minimal POS terms**:\n   Simplification could merge/interact terms minimally, but each product usually represents key intersecting minimal forms directly.\n\nTherefore, under our simplified direct conversion without extraneous merging complexity, the minimal POS expression directly derives from these fundamental product contributions. The minimal representation - keeping straightforward critical counts - typically maintains the individual minimal consistencies.\n\nThus, the minimal POS form directly states the form intersections contributing to key terms\u2019 minimal counts:\n\nThus, the minimal expression retains three terms considering given expression structures, ensuring no loss of accuracy without advanced simplifications merging multiple terms redundantly.\n\nSo the correct minimal POS term count, directly transformed, is:\n   \n   **(D"

The primary disadvantage is related to its behavior under certain conditions, particularly when both inputs (Set and Reset) are high.\n\nWhen both inputs to a NAND gate RS Latch are high, it enters into an indeterminate state where both outputs are high, which is typically not a valid or stable logical state for the latch. This indeterminate state can lead to unpredictable behavior and instability, making the latch sensitive to noise and timing issues. Therefore, the circuit is prone to erroneous outputs due to its inherent susceptibility to noise.\n\nGiven the choices:\n(A) Limited number of stable states\n(B) Increased power consumption\n(C) Complexity in design\n(D) Susceptibility to noise\n\nThe correct answer is:\n(D) Susceptibility to noise"

        "response": "To determine how often the output Q of a positive-edge triggered D flip-flop changes value, we need to understand the behavior of the flip-flop. \n\nA positive-edge triggered D flip-flop updates its output Q to match the input D at the moment of the rising (positive) edge of the clock signal. This means that Q can only change state on the rising edge of the clock.\n\nBased on this, let\u2019s analyze the given choices:\n\n(A) Once every second - This would depend on the actual frequency of the clock signal, which is not provided in the question. Since Q is not tied to an absolute time interval like a second, this is not a correct option without further information.\n\n(B) Once every 2 clock cycles - This would imply that Q doesn't necessarily update with every rising edge, which could only happen if there is some additional external control or condition that makes Q change every 2 cycles. However, in a standard positive-edge triggered D flip-flop, Q can change on every positive clock edge, so this is not accurate.\n\n(C) Once every clock cycle - This option states that Q updates with every positive edge of the clock cycle. Since Q changes state based on the D input at every rising edge, Q has the opportunity to change its value once every clock cycle if the D input is changing.\n\n(D) Twice every clock cycle - This is incorrect because a positive-edge triggered flip-flop only updates its state on the rising edge, not both rising and falling edges. Therefore, Q cannot change twice in a single clock cycle.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Once every clock cycle"

        "response": "To determine what makes a D flip-flop different from a gated latch, let's understand the characteristics of both devices:\n\n1. **D Flip-Flop**:\n    - A D (Data or Delay) flip-flop is a synchronous device. This means that its data output transitions occur in sync with a clock signal. The output of the D flip-flop only changes at the edge of the clock signal.\n    - It typically responds to the rising or falling edge of the clock signal.\n    - D flip-flops are used in designing sequential circuits and systems that rely on precise timing and synchronization.\n\n2. **Gated Latch**:\n    - A gated latch, on the other hand, is a level-sensitive device. This means that its output can change as long as the gated (enable) signal is active (high or low depending on the design).\n    - It doesn't have a clock signal to synchronize its output changes, so it is not considered a synchronous device.\n    - A gated latch can be made of NAND or NOR gates, depending on the specific design.\n\nWith this understanding, let's evaluate the given choices:\n\n(A) **This FF is synchronous, while a gated latch is not**:\n- Correct. A D flip-flop is a synchronous device operating in sync with a clock signal, whereas a gated latch does not operate synchronously.\n\n(B) **This FF is asynchronous, while a gated latch is not**:\n- Incorrect. A D flip-flop is synchronous, not asynchronous.\n\n(C) **This FF can be made of NAND gates, while a gated latch cannot**:\n- Incorrect. Both D flip-flops and gated latches can be made using NAND gates depending on the design.\n\n(D) **This FF is usually made of NOR gates, while a gated latch is not**:\n- Incorrect. Both D flip-flops and gated latches can be made using either NAND or NOR gates. The choice of gates generally depends on the specific design requirements rather than a definitive difference between the two.\n\nGiven the explanations, the correct answer is:\n\n**(A) This FF is synchronous, while a gated latch is not**"

However, we also need a mechanism to combine these two 8:1 muxes into a single 16:1 mux.\n\nHere's the step-by-step construction:\n\n1. **Two 8:1 Muxes**: These will handle the input selection for the lower 8 inputs (D0-D7) and the upper 8 inputs (D8-D15) respectively. Each 8:1 mux has 8 data inputs and 3 select lines.\n2. **Additional Mux for Selection Between 8:1 Muxes**: We need a way to decide whether to take the output from the first 8:1 mux or the second 8:1 mux. This can be done using a 2:1 mux which can select between the two outputs of the 8:1 muxes.\n\nLet\u2019s assign the select lines as follows:\n- The first 3 select lines (S0, S1, and S2) would go to both 8:1 muxes.\n- The 4th select line (S3) would go to the 2:1 mux.

        "response": "A 3:8 decoder takes 3 input lines and decodes them into 8 unique output lines. Each output corresponds to one of the 8 combinations of the 3 inputs. \n\nTo construct the 3:8 decoder, we think about the binary combinations of the 3 input lines (let\u2019s say A, B, C). The output lines can be represented based on the binary combinations of these inputs as follows:\n\n- When (A, B, C) is (0, 0, 0) -> Output Y0\n- When (A, B, C) is (0, 0, 1) -> Output Y1\n- When (A, B, C) is (0, 1, 0) -> Output Y2\n- When (A, B, C) is (0, 1, 1) -> Output Y3\n- When (A, B, C) is (1, 0, 0) -> Output Y4\n- When (A, B, C) is (1, 0, 1) -> Output Y5\n- When (A, B, C) is (1, 1, 0) -> Output Y6\n- When (A, B, C) is (1, 1, 1) -> Output Y7\n\nEach of these outputs can be generated using AND gates combined with the necessary NOT gates if needed to get the required input inversions. \n\nFor example:\n- Y0 (000) = NOT(A) AND NOT(B) AND NOT(C)\n- Y1 (001) = NOT(A) AND NOT(B) AND C\n- Y2 (010) = NOT(A) AND B AND NOT(C)\n- Y3 (011) = NOT(A) AND B AND C\n- Y4 (100) = A AND NOT(B) AND NOT(C)\n- Y5 (101) = A AND NOT(B) AND C\n- Y6 (110) = A AND B AND NOT(C)\n- Y7 (111) = A AND B AND C\n\nFrom these expressions, each output is generated using one AND gate. So there are 8 AND gates. To implement the NOT operations, you need to invert the input lines wherever necessary:\n- You need to invert A for Y0, Y1, Y2, Y3 (1 NOT gate)\n- You need to invert B for"
