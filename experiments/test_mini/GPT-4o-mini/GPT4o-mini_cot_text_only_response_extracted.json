        "response": "To analyze the primary disadvantage of a NAND gate based RS latch compared to other types of latches or flip-flops, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) **Limited number of stable states**: This is not correct, as a NAND gate RS latch can maintain two stable states (Set and Reset), just like other latches.\n\n(B) **Increased power consumption**: Generally, RS latches do not consume significantly more power than other latches or flip-flops. Therefore, this option is likely not the primary disadvantage.\n\n(C) **Complexity in design**: NAND gate latches are relatively simple in design. Most latches and flip-flops can be made with similar levels of complexity depending on the context, so this option is not the primary disadvantage.\n\n(D) **Susceptibility to noise**: NAND gate latches can be more susceptible to noise compared to other types of flip-flops like edge-triggered flip-flops. This is because any transient noise can inadvertently change the state of the latch.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the primary disadvantage of a NAND gate based RS latch compared to other latches or flip-flops is its susceptibility to noise.\n\nThus, the correct option is: **D**.",

        "response": "To understand the function of the clock signal (CLK) in a J-K flip-flop, let's analyze its role step by step:\n\n1. **Flip-flop Basics**: A J-K flip-flop is a type of bistable multivibrator that has two inputs (J and K) and one output (Q). It changes its output state based on these inputs and the clock signal.\n\n2. **Role of the Clock (CLK)**:\n   - The clock signal serves as a timing reference for when the J and K inputs should affect the output Q.\n   - The state changes of the flip-flop occur only on a specific transition of the clock signal (usually on the rising or falling edge).\n\n3. **Synchronized State Changes**: The primary function of the clock in digital circuits, including flip-flops, is to synchronize state changes. This means that the outputs will change in coordination with the clock signal, ensuring that the system operates correctly and predictably in relation to time.\n\n4. **Evaluating Other Choices**:\n   - (B) To provide power to the circuit: The clock does not provide power; it's a control signal.\n   - (C) To reset the flip-flop: Resetting is typically accomplished via a separate reset input, not directly by the clock.\n   - (D) To enable the J and K inputs: While the clock does allow the inputs to take effect, its main role is synchronization rather than enabling.\n\nConsidering the above explanations, we conclude that the function of the clock signal in a J-K flip-flop is to synchronize the state changes.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is **(A)**.",

        "response": "To answer the question about what happens when both R' and S' are high at the same time in a NAND R-S latch, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding R-S Latch**: A NAND R-S latch is built using NAND gates. It has two inputs, R (Reset) and S (Set), with their active-low inputs being R' and S'. This means that R' is the reset input, and S' is the set input.\n\n2. **Input Conditions**:\n   - When R' is low (0), the latch can reset the output (Q) to 0.\n   - When S' is low (0), the latch can set the output (Q) to 1.\n   - When both R' and S' are high (1), we need to analyze the output behavior.\n\n3. **When R' and S' are High**:\n   - If R' = 1 and S' = 1, both NAND gates in the latch will have both their inputs as 1.\n   - The output from each NAND gate can be analyzed:\n     - \\( Q = \\overline{R' \\cdot Q'} \\)\n     - \\( Q' = \\overline{S' \\cdot Q} \\)\n   - With R' and S' both high, the outputs of both gates would be 1 unless there was a feedback loop forcing the outputs to change.\n\n4. **State Analysis**:\n   - In this condition, the outputs stay in their last state due to the feedback from the outputs to the inputs through the NAND gates.\n   - Therefore, the latch remains in a stable state as long as no reset or set inputs are activated.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both inputs (R' and S') being high maintains the latch in its previous state without moving towards a reset or a setup, the correct outcome is a stable state.\n\nGiven the options presented:\n- (A) Stable state \n- (B) P = Q \n- (C) Metastable state - state that rapidly alternates between 0 and 1 \n- (D) Bistability \n\nThe recommended answer is **(A) Stable state**.\n\nSo, the final answer is: **A**.",

The output changes only at a specific moment when the clock signal transitions.\n\n3. **Edge Sensitivity**: \n   - A D Flip-Flop is typically sensitive to the rising edge of the clock signal.

In contrast, a gated latch does not have a clock signal but instead changes state based on the enable signal. This statement is indeed correct.\n\n(B) **This FF is asynchronous, while a gated latch is not**: \n- This is incorrect. A D Flip-Flop is synchronous, which means it is not asynchronous.\n\n(C) **This FF can be made of NAND gates, while a gated latch cannot**: \n- This statement may be misleading as both D Flip-Flops and gated latches can be made using NAND or NOR gates, depending on the design. So, this option is not accurate.\n\n(D) **This FF is usually made of NOR gates, while a gated latch is not**: \n- This is also not entirely accurate, as both types can be constructed using either NAND or NOR gates, and does not differentiate them.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, the most accurate statement about the difference between a D Flip-Flop and a gated latch is:\n\n**(A) This FF is synchronous, while a gated latch is not.**\n\nFinal Answer: **A**",

This is a single condition that can be directly implemented with an AND gate in conjunction with a NOT gate.\n   \n2. **AC'**: This term indicates that the output will also be high when both A is high (1) and C is low (0). This requires two inputs: A and C, along with a NOT for C.\n\nGiven the constraints that we are only allowed to use one OR gate, we will analyze how many AND gates we need:\n\n### Breakdown of the Logic:\n\n- **For B'**:\n  - We need a NOT gate to convert B to B'.\n  - Then, we need to include that term in an OR gate. \n  - However, B' can be directly fed to the OR gate without needing an AND gate.\n\n- **For AC'**:\n  - First, we need a NOT gate for C to get C'.\n  - Then, we need to combine A and C' using an AND gate.\n\n### Gate Count:\n\n1. **NOT gates**: \n   - One NOT for B to get B'\n   - One NOT for C to get C'\n\n2. **AND gates**:\n   - One AND gate to combine A and C'.\n\n3. **OR gate**: \n   - One OR gate to combine B' and the output from the AND gate (A and C').\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Total AND gates needed = **1** (for AC')\n- So the answer to how many AND gates we need in the circuit is **1**.\n\nPutting this all together, the answer to the question is:\n\n**(B)**",

Until that edge occurs, the output Q does not immediately change based on the D input.\n\n2. **Initial State Consideration**: Since the question asks what Q is before the rising edge of the clock and given that D = 1, we need to determine what effect D has on Q before the clock triggers.\n\n3. **Behavior Before Clock Edge**: Before the rising edge, Q retains its previous value; it does not change instantly with changes to the D input. Therefore, if the last state of Q was 0 before D became 1, Q would still be 0 until the clock edge.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the value of D = 1 does not affect Q until the clock edge occurs, the value of Q remains whatever it was prior to this state. \n\nThe correct answer is: **(C) Q value stays the same until rising edge of clock signal**.\n\nThus, the final answer is **C**.",

For a 16:1 mux, 4 select lines (S0, S1, S2, S3) are required since \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\n2. **Selecting the Inputs**:\n   - The select lines are typically used to enable one of the inputs. The combination of these select lines directs the chosen input to the output.\n\n3. **Implementing the Select Logic**:\n   - To implement the selection logic, several AND gates and NOT gates are used.\n   - Each input (I0 to I15) needs a specific combination of select lines to be active. The 4 select lines will produce 16 combinations, and each combination can be connected to an AND gate that corresponds to one input.\n\n4. **Counting the NOT Gates**:\n   - Each select line must be able to be both true and false (normal and inverted). Therefore, each select line will typically require one NOT gate.\n   - For 4 select lines (S0, S1, S2, S3), we need 4 NOT gates to provide the inverted states (\\(\\overline{S0}, \\overline{S1}, \\overline{S2}, \\overline{S3}\\)).\n  \n### Conclusion:\nSo, for a 16:1 multiplexer, you would typically find **4 NOT gates** corresponding to the 4 select lines.\n\nThe correct answer is **D**.",

We have a bit called \"HOLD\" that represents whether or not the counter should retain its value for the next cycle. What is the expression for S1+ (next-state bit for S1)? Write the expression in terms of HOLD, S2, S1, and S0.  Choices: (A) HOLD (B) (HOLD)'S0 + (HOLD)S1 (C)  (HOLD)S0 + (HOLD)'S1'  (D) (HOLD)(S1' + S0')'  "

        "response": "To analyze the expression \\( E = ((\\neg A) \\downarrow (\\neg B)) \\downarrow ((\\neg C) \\downarrow (\\neg D)) \\), where \\(\\neg\\) denotes NOT and \\(\\downarrow\\) denotes NOR, we can simplify the circuit using De Morgan's Theorem.\n\n1. **Understanding NOR**: \n   The NOR gate outputs true only when both of its inputs are false. The expression \\( X \\downarrow Y \\) is equivalent to \\( \\neg (X \\vee Y) \\).\n\n2. **Breaking down the original expression**:\n   - \\( \\neg A \\downarrow \\neg B \\) can be expressed as \\( \\neg (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B) \\).\n   - This simplifies further using De Morgan's Theorem:\n     \\[\n     \\neg (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B) = A \\land B.\n     \\]\n   - So, \\( \\neg A \\downarrow \\neg B = A \\land B \\).\n\nSimilarly, we can analyze the second part of the expression:\n   - \\( \\neg C \\downarrow \\neg D \\) simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\neg (\\neg C \\vee \\neg D) = C \\land D.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg C \\downarrow \\neg D = C \\land D \\).\n\n3. **Combining results**:\n   The overall expression can now be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   E = (A \\land B) \\downarrow (C \\land D).\n   \\]\n   Applying the definition of NOR:\n   \\[\n   E = \\neg((A \\land B) \\vee (C \\land D)).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identifying the equivalent gate**:\n   We see that the overall structure of \\( E \\) is the negation of an OR operation, which can be realized using a NAND gate. A NAND gate outputs true unless both inputs are true, meaning it gives the negation of an AND operation:\n\n   From the above:\n   \\[\n   E = \\neg((A \\land B) \\vee (C \\land D))\n   \\]\n   is not directly equal to a single AND gate but relates to the logic of a NAND gate since a NAND gate represents \\( \\neg (X \\land Y) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the simplifications, we",
