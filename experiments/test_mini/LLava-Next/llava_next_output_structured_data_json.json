Using a mux (multiplexer) here is beneficial because it ensures that the clock signal is not affected by any other signals in the circuit. This is important because the clock signal is used to synchronize the operation of the flip-flop, and any interference with the clock signal could cause timing errors or other problems in the circuit.
