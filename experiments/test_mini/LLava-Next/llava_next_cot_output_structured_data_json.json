        "response": "The simplest expression for this circuit in product-of-sums form is option (D).\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We can start by observing that the circuit is a combination of AND gates and OR gates.\n2. The AND gates are connected in a series, and the OR gates are connected in a series.\n3. To simplify the circuit, we can use the distributive property of AND and OR gates.\n4. The AND gates can be simplified using the AND gate property, which states that A'C' + A'D' + B'C' + B'D' = A'C'D' + B'C'D'.\n5. The OR gates can be simplified using the OR gate property, which states that A' + B' + C' + D' = A'C' + B'C' + A'D' + B'D'.\n6. Now, we can substitute the simplified AND and OR gates into the original circuit.\n7.

The delay of a gate is determined by the number of gates connected to it.\n\nIn the given circuit, the OR gate has two inputs, and each input comes from an AND gate. Therefore, the OR gate delay is 2 (since it has two inputs).\n\nIf we were to build this circuit minimally from only OR and AND gates, we would need to replace the AND gates with OR gates and the OR gate with AND gates. This would result in a total of 4 gates (2 OR gates and 2 AND gates).\n\nNow, let's calculate the delay of each gate:\n- The OR gate delay would be 2, as it has two inputs.\n- The AND gate delay would be 1, as it has two inputs.\n\nSince the OR gate delay is 2 and the AND gate delay is 1, the total delay of the circuit would be 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(A) Increase by one gate delay (This is incorrect because the delay would increase by 2 gate delays, not 1.)\n(B) Decrease by one gate delay (This is incorrect because the delay would decrease by 2 gate delays, not 1.)\n(C) Decrease by 2 gate delays (This is incorrect because the delay would not change, as the number of gates would increase.)\n(D) Would not change (This is the correct answer. The delay of the circuit would not change, as the number of gates would increase, but the delay of each gate would remain the same.)"

The flip-flop is negative-edge triggered, meaning that the inputs are sampled at the negative edge of the clock signal.\n\nTo determine if the flip-flop is negative-edge triggered, we need to look at the clock signal and the inputs. The clock signal is shown as a dashed line, and it is rising from 0 to 1. This indicates that the clock signal is positive-edge triggered.\n\nHowever, the inputs are sampled at the negative edge of the clock signal.
