If we replace this NAND gate with a NOR gate, the behavior changes significantly. NOR gates output 1 only when all inputs are 0, and 0 otherwise.\n\n3.

The gate shown in the diagram is an AND gate with an inverted output, which is known as a NAND (Not AND) gate.\n\n2. The question asks what would happen if we inverted the inputs of this gate.\n\n3. When we invert the inputs of a NAND gate, we get the equivalent of a NOR gate. This is due to De Morgan's laws in Boolean algebra.\n\n4. A NOR gate produces a high output only if all inputs are low. It's essentially an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.\n\n5. Looking at our options, the gate that matches this description is the OR gate with an inverted output.\n\nTherefore, if we inverted the inputs of the NAND gate shown in the diagram, it would be equivalent to an OR gate with an inverted output.\n\nThe correct answer is: D"

Power consumption is not significantly higher than other basic latch designs.\n\nThe primary disadvantage of this circuit lies in its susceptibility to noise. The SR latch can be sensitive to small fluctuations or glitches in the input signals, which can cause unwanted state changes. This is because there's no clock signal to synchronize input changes, and the latch responds immediately to any input variations.\n\nMore advanced flip-flop designs, such as D flip-flops or edge-triggered flip-flops, incorporate additional circuitry to make them less susceptible to noise and provide more controlled state changes.\n\nTherefore, the primary disadvantage of this circuit compared to other types of latches or flip-flops is its susceptibility to noise.\n\nD"

        "response": "To analyze this scenario, let's examine the logic circuit:\n\n1. The inputs L (Lychee), B (Blend), and M (Mango) are all activated when all buttons are pressed.\n\n2. Each input goes through a NOT gate (the triangle with a circle), which inverts the signal.\n\n3. The outputs of these NOT gates are then fed into three AND gates (the D-shaped symbols).\n\n4. For the top AND gate (CL[1]), it receives a direct input from L and inverted inputs from B and M. When all buttons are pressed, this gate receives (1, 0, 0), resulting in a 0 output.\n\n5. The middle AND gate receives inverted inputs from L and M, and a direct input from B. It gets (0, 1, 0), also resulting in a 0 output.\n\n6. The bottom AND gate (CM[1]) receives inverted inputs from L and B, and a direct input from M. It gets (0, 0, 1), again resulting in a 0 output.\n\n7. Since all AND gates output 0, both CL[0] and CM[0] will be 1 (as they are the inverse of CL[1] and CM[1] respectively).\n\nWhen CL[0] and CM[0] are both 1, it indicates that neither the Lychee nor the Mango flavors are selected for output. This means that when all buttons are pressed simultaneously, the machine's logic prevents any ice cream from being dispensed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD"

        "response": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the K-map and consider how changing each scenario would affect the overall circuit complexity.\n\nThe current K-map shows that the machine dispenses a product (output = 1) when:\n- Only C is pressed (C'=0, AB=00)\n- A and B are pressed without C (C=1, AB=11)\n- Either A or B is pressed with C (C=1, AB=01 or AB=10)\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n(A) Pressing only A: This would change the 0 to 1 in the C'=0, AB=01 cell. This would simplify the function, potentially reducing circuit size.\n\n(B) Pressing only A and C: This is already a 1 in the K-map, so no change.\n\n(C) Pressing A, B, and C: This would change the 0 to 1 in the C=1, AB=11 cell. This is already adjacent to other 1s and would likely simplify the function.\n\n(D) Pressing only B and C: This would change the 0 to 1 in the C=1, AB=10 cell. This cell is already surrounded by 1s, so changing it to 1 would create a larger group of 1s, simplifying the function.\n\nThe only option that would potentially increase the circuit size is changing the scenario where only A is pressed (C'=0, AB=01).
