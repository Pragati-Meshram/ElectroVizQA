The current circuit likely uses a NOR gate, which is a combination of an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.\n\n2. To build this circuit minimally using only OR and AND gates, we would need to replace the NOR gate with its equivalent using these gates.\n\n3. The De Morgan's Law equivalent of a NOR gate is: (A NOR B) = NOT(A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B)\n\n4. To implement this, we would need:\n   - An OR gate for (A OR B)\n   - Two NOT gates for (NOT A) and (NOT B)\n   - An AND gate for the final operation\n\n5. However, since we're restricted to using only OR and AND gates, we need to replace each NOT gate with its OR-AND equivalent:\n   NOT(X) = (X OR X) AND (NOT 1) = (X OR X) AND (1 OR 1)\n\n6. This means each NOT operation adds two more gate delays (one OR and one AND).\n\n7. In total, the minimal implementation using only OR and AND gates would require:\n   - 1 OR gate (original input)\n   - 4 OR gates (two for each NOT operation)\n   - 3 AND gates (two for NOT operations, one for final AND)\n\n8. This results in a total of 8 gate delays (assuming each gate has one unit of delay), compared to the original circuit which likely had only 2 gate delays (one for OR, one for NOT in the NOR gate).\n\nTherefore, the delay of the circuit would increase significantly if built minimally from only OR and AND gates.\n\nThe correct answer is: A (",

The question asks what happens if we invert the inputs of this NAND gate.\n\n3. When we invert the inputs of a NAND gate, we're essentially applying De Morgan's law.\n\n4. De Morgan's law states that:\n   NOT(A AND B) = (NOT A) OR (NOT B)\n\n5. In this case, we're starting with a NAND gate, which is already NOT(A AND B).\n\n6. By inverting the inputs, we're applying NOT to both A and B before they enter the gate.\n\n7. This results in:\n   NOT(NOT A AND NOT B)\n\n8. Applying De Morgan's law again, this is equivalent to:\n   (NOT NOT A) OR (NOT NOT B)\n\n9. The double NOTs cancel out, leaving us with:\n   A OR B\n\nTherefore, inverting the inputs of a NAND gate results in an OR gate.\n\nThe correct answer is: D",

Simple latches and flip-flops can be sensitive to spurious signals or glitches, which can cause unintended state changes.\n\nMore advanced designs often incorporate features to reduce noise sensitivity, such as Schmitt triggers or additional logic gates.

The most common trigger for these changes is the rising edge (also called the positive edge) of the clock signal.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n\n(A) is incorrect because values don't necessarily freeze every second. The clock frequency could be much faster or slower than one second.\n\n(B) is incorrect because it mentions \"positive edge\" but doesn't specify that this is when values are stored or changed.\n\n(C) is incorrect because in a clocked digital system, values are controlled and change at specific times, not rapidly and uncontrollably.\n\n(D) is correct. In most digital systems, flip-flops and registers store or change their values on the rising edge of the clock signal.

Analyze the K-Map and identify the largest possible groups of 1s (minterms).\n2. Each group will represent a product term in the minimized Boolean expression.\n3. The number of product terms will equal the number of AND gates needed.\n\nSince we're told to use only one OR gate, this implies that the minimized function has at most two product terms. If there were more than two product terms, we would need more than one OR gate to combine them.\n\nGiven this constraint, the answer must be either 1 or 2 AND gates.\n\nThe question states that we should build the circuit \"minimally,\" which means we should use the fewest possible gates.
